# Student_Performance
This is the project based on the performance of student.
 In this project,Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) ,Data processing and feature engineering, Modelling, Prediction of average marks through regression is used
Arrays, Dataframes, Charts and Graphs are used in this project for visualisation.
Arrays, Dataframes, Charts and visualisation are used to observe and predict  the trends,correlation of the data
Through EDA , a countplot bar to count the number of males and females is created.
A countplot to observe the age distribution is also created
A boxplot is created to check the outliers
A crosstab is created for Gender and Study_hours_Group
Gender wise Physics, Chemistry, Maths marks are obtained by using pandas.
A heatmap visualization of the aggregated data using Seaborn is created to predict the correlation of gender and study group hours.
Continuous featues such as age, IQ are coverted into bins as machine learning models dont work well with continuous features.
Histograms of age, IQ, Average marks are created
Two subplots that are side by side, and both of them are  displaying a heatmap using Seaborn to visualize the mean marks for 'Math_Marks,' 'Physics_Marks,' and 'Chemistry_Marks' based on two different grouping criteria : 'IQ_Band' and 'Age_Band are created.
Data Preprocessing anf feature engineering is used .
Modelling using Scikit learn
Average Marks are predicted
 mean absolute error is calculated
